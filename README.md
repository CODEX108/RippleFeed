This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.



### Let's see what special file names and folder naming patterns we can use in the app folder added in NextJs 13.

- Right from the start, NextJs followed a "convention over configuration" paradigm, using reserved naming conventions for most common use cases. This decrease the complexity and the number of decisions we need to take as programmers.

- As a side note, each file I will mention here with a js extension can also have a tsx extension if you want to use typescript in your project.

Reserved file names in the app folder #
Let's take a look at the reserved file names:

page.js is the main entry point for each folder. This file will contain the main content of the page that will be served from that folder. Wrote this short getting guide about it here
layout.js will contain the wrapping layout for our pages. The layout.js file is autogenerated in the root app folder if we don't provide one. These layouts preserve state and can also be nested or shared. Before having the layout we were using the _app file
template.js is very similar to layout.js just that this one will not preserve the state as it always remounts on navigation. Added a more in-depth post about templates in NextJs.
head.js is the file that we will use to customize the head of our page. Things such as setting page metatags, title and so on. As with `app/layout.js` a default app/head.js will be auto-generated at the first run if none is provided by us. This was previously done by the `'next/head`' component
`layout.js` and error.js are both used in data fetching to show the intermediate states. Wrote this guide about how to use the loading file in NextJs
not-found.js used for rendering the error screen for a not found item
Special naming conventions for folders in NextJs 13 app folder #
Alongside the reserved names of the above files, we also have some special naming conventions for the folders we pun in `/app`:

`[id]`: these are the query parameters for routing. Using them we can have paths such as product/1, product/2, or product/123. Of course, we can have anything else besides `[id]`, such as `[slug]` or `[title]`;
`[...folder_name_here]`: they are called catch-all segments. If the previous [id] will only be mapped to URLs like /product/1 a catch-all segment will get also URLs as /product/1/2 or /product/1/2/3/test. Wrote more details about them here.
(folder_name_here): they have also named route groups and they can be used to organize routes without affecting the URL or to create shared layouts in NextJs. They don't need to contain a page.js;
